# NetParser
## A little json parser to simply create small networks based on lxc/lxd

## Introduction
JSON files are placed in the templates directory.
You can parse them using the parseTemplateFile.sh placed in the baseScripts directory.
But take care, you should send the command from the root directory as links in files
aren't absolute ones.

## Examples
If you want to start the 3nets3hosts.json template, you should use the next command 
and be sure that you are in the root directory.

```sh
# cd netParser
# ./baseScripts/parseTemplateFile.sh templates/3nets3hosts.json
```

Then the networks and hosts should be up in a minute or two depending on the size 
of the network
